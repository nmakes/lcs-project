Q1. A simple expression reducer
===============================

This prolog program simplifies (reduces) a given SOP or POS expression. For eg.

2*x*6*y + x*9*3 + x*y*1 = 27*x + 13*x*y
(x+8+2)*(7+y+x+9) = (x+10)*(16+x+y)

This is represented in the model as follows:
	s([  p([2,6,xy]),  p([x,9,3]),  p([xy,1])  ])
and
	p([  s([x,8,2]),  s([7,y,x,9])  ])

NOTE:
1. x,y used above are variables.
2. The s() predicate takes a list and represents the sum of the list elements.
3. The p() predicate takes a list and represents the product of the list elements.
4. A variable x in mathematics can be represented by s([0,x]) or p([1,x]) in this program.
5. There must be at least one number in the list.

IMPORTANT NOTE: 
When giving an input expression, the product of variables x*y*z is to be written as a single variable xyz in the list of the product predicate.

--

To get the reduced expression, we use the reduce predicate which is of the form reduce(Expr, Result).
This will set the Result variable to the reduced form of the expression represented by Expr.
Hence, 

?- reduce(s([  p([2,6,xy]),  p([x,9,3]),  p([xy,1])  ]), RESULT).
RESULT = s([p([xy, 12]), p([x, 27]), p([xy, 1])]).

?- reduce(p([  s([x,8,2]),  s([7,y,x,9])  ]), RESULT).
RESULT = p([s([x, 10]), s([y, x, 16])]).

--

Equality of two expressions can be tested by using the equal predicate defined. For eg.

?- equal(s([p([3,x])]), s([p([1,x]), p([3,x])])).
false.


==========================
Q2. Student Knowledge base
==========================

This program will give the details about a student and the courses availible at BITS. This has also covered various registration norms, like late registration etc. We have given a sample set of data in the program itself. For this sample data, some of the queries that can be asked are as follows:

?- eligiblePs1(namo).
false.

?- allowedToRegister(jay,c(g,512,4,eee)).
false.

?- registerForC(jay, c(f,351,3,cs)).
false.
